# 4760Assignment2
Concurrent Linux Processes and shared memory
---
## Relavent Information:
**Using the Makefile:**
1. `make`: will compile the prgram. 
2. `./runsim (number of processes) < testing data`: will run the program. 
3. `make clean`: will clean the Makefile. 

**Task:**
1. runsim reads a command from stdin in each iteration of its loop and forks a child.
2. The child, in turn, forks a grandchild that calls execl and executes the application
3. The child waits for the grandchild (application) to complete and then exits
4. The program uses the bakery algorithm to control the access to license manager

**The critical resource is the license object, or the number of licenses. This will be accessed by the license objectâ€™s
public functions which now constitute the critical section.**
